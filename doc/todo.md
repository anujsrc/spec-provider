# TODO/ideas

* Handle the same key appearing in different depths by merging the
  stats and summarizing them as a single entity.
* Collect nilable
* Collect min/max for numbers -> s/int-in
* Collect min/max length for strings
* Collect min/max length for sequential
* Super strict mode that restricts lengths of strings, min/max on numbers, length of lists etc
* BUG: 6.0 results in (clojure.spec/or :double double? :float float?)
