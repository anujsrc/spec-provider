# spec-provider

This is a library that will produce a best-guess
[Clojure spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) based on multiple
examples of in memory data. The inferred spec is *not* meant to be
used as is and without human supervision, it is rather a starting
point that can (and should) be refined.

The idea is analogous to F# type providers -- specifically the JSON
type provider, but the input in the case of spec-provider is any
in-memory Clojure data structure.

Since Clojure spec is still in alpha, this library should also be
considered to be in alpha, so highly experimental, very likely to
change, possibly flawed.

## Usage

To use this library, add this dependency to your `project.clj` file:

## Use cases

The are two main use cases for spec-provider:

1. You have a lot of examples of raw data (maybe in a JSONB column of
   a PostreSQL table) and you'd like to:

   * See a summary of what shape the data is. You can use
     spec-provider as a way to explore new datasets.

   * You already know what shape your data is, and you just want some
     helping getting started writing a spec for it because your data
     is deeply nested, has a lot of corner cases, you're lazy etc.

   * You *think* you know what shape your data is, but because it's
     neither typed checked nor contract checked, some exceptions have
     sneaked into it. Instead of eyeballing 100,000 maps, you run
     spec-provider on them and to your surprise you find that one of
     the fields is `(s/or :integer integer? :string string?)` instead
     of just string as you expected. You can use spec-provider as a
     data debugging tool.

2. You have an un-spec'ed function and you also have a good way to
   exercise it (via unit tests, actual usage etc). You can instrument
   the function with spec-provider, run it a few times with actual
   data, and then ask spec-provider for the function spec based on the
   data that flowed through the function.

## Inferring the spec of raw data

To infer a spec of a bunch of data just pass the data to the
`infer-specs` function:

```clojure
> (require '[spec-provider.provider :as sp])

> (def inferred-specs
    (sp/infer-specs
     [{:a 8  :b "foo" :c :k}
      {:a 10 :b "bar" :c "k"}
      {:a 1  :b "baz" :c "k"}]
     :toy/small-map))

> inferred-specs

((clojure.spec/def :toy/c (clojure.spec/or :keyword keyword? :string string?))
 (clojure.spec/def :toy/b string?)
 (clojure.spec/def :toy/a integer?)
 (clojure.spec/def :toy/small-map (clojure.spec/keys :req-un [:toy/a :toy/b :toy/c])))
```

The sequence of specs that you get out of `infer-spec` is technically
correct, but not very useful for pasting into your code. Luckily, you
can do:

```clojure
> (pprint-specs inferred-specs 'toy 's)

(s/def ::c (s/or :keyword keyword? :string string?))
(s/def ::b string?)
(s/def ::a integer?)
(s/def ::small-map (s/keys :req-un [::a ::b ::c]))
```

Passing `'toy` to `pprint-specs` signals that we intend to paste this
code into the `toy` namespace, so spec names are printed using the
`::` syntax.

Passing `'s` signals that we are going to require clojure.spec as `s`,
so the calls to `clojure.spec/def` become `s/def` etc.

### How it's done

Inferring a spec from raw data is a two step process: Stats collection
and then summarization of the stats into specs.

First each data structure is visited recursively and statistics are
collected at each level about the types of values that appear, the
distinct values for each field (up to a limit), min and max values for
numbers, lengths for sequences etc.

Two important points about stats collection:

* Spec-provider **will not** run out of memory even if you throw a lot
  of data at it because it updates the same statistics data structure
  with every new example datum it receives.

* Collecting stats will (at least partly) realize lazy sequences.

After stats collection, code from the `spec-provider.provider`
namespace goes through the stats and it summarizes it as a collection
of specs.

## Limitations

* There is no attempt to infer the regular expression of collections.
* There is no attempt to infer tuples.
* There is no attempt to infer `multi-spec`.
* For functions, only the `:args` and `:ret` parts of the spec is
  generated, the `:fn` part is up to you.
* Spec-provider assumes that you want to follow the Clojure spec
  convention that the same map keys identify the same "entity", so it
  will merge stats that appear under the identical keys but in
  different parts of your tree structure. This may not be what you
  want. For more details see the "Merging" section.

## FAQ

* Will I run out of memory if I pass a lot of examples of my data to
  `infer-specs`?

  No, stats collection works by updating the same data structure with
  every example of data received. The data structure will initially
  grow a bit and then maintain a constant size. That means that you
  can use a lazy sequence to stream your huge table through it if you
  feel that's necessary (not tested!).

* Can I do this for Prismatic schema?

  The hard part of inferring a spec is collecting the
  statistics. Summarizing the stats as specs was relatively easy, so
  plugging in a different "summarizer" that will output schemas from
  the same stats should be possible. Look at the `provider` namespace,
  write the schema equivalent and send me a pull request!
